# QuantumMeasurement
Simulates quantum measurement.
Should be generalizable to work with any combination of quantum state and orthonormal basis

Tested with 2 simple examples

First example uses standard orthonormal basis.
Second example uses arbitrary orthonormal basis

1. Have a quantum system with a quantum state
2. Measure quantum state w.r.t. the basis
3. When you measure w.r.t. the given basis, will collapse into different possible states
4. Each of the different possible states has a percentage chance of occurring associated
with them.
